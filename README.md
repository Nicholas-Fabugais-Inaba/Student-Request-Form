# Student-Request-Form
An HTML document utilizing JavaScript that allows students to input information notifying them of the total cost needed to buy a certain amount of marks for their courses.
The student enters in their student id, the course code, a short one word description of the course, and the amount of additional marks they are requesting for the class.
Additionally, they will check off a checkbox if the course is not done in person. Once the go for it button is pressed, the number of the course (ie. the first course is shown by 1)
will be shown as well as the total cost. The total cost will continue to increase until $250 for the amount of marks requested for courses is surpassed as it will then ask to 
clear and reset the request form.
